This readme will guide you through the installation and running of the application using Docker. Let's get started! 🚀

## Requirements 📋

To embark on this trading adventure, you will need the following requirements:

- Docker 🐳

Make sure you have Docker installed on your system before proceeding.

## Installation ⚙️

To set up the Trading Platform using Docker, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Build the Docker image by running the following command:

   ```
   docker build -t trading_platform .
   ```

   This will build the Docker image based on the provided Dockerfile.

## Running the Application 🏃‍♀️

To start the Trading Platform application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Run the Docker container with the following command:

   ```
   docker run -p 8000:8000 trading_platform
   ```

   This will start the Trading Platform application inside a Docker container. The `-p 8000:8000` flag maps port 8000 of the container to port 8000 of the host machine.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to access the Trading Platform.
